# How to Compile Yourself

This is a Visual Studio 2022 project, this means you need to have Visual Studio 2022 Installed. To compile you will also need the WiX toolchain version 3.11 installed on your system aswell as an extension inside of visual studio code. During compiling you can get some errors, I have included the MicrosoftEdgeWebView2Setup.exe file that needs to be located at C:/Temp. If you get any errors regarding commands in a .targets file, you can use the .targets file I have uploaded.
