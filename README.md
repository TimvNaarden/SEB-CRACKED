It can be downloaded at the release page. IF you run the provided installer it is detectable as a crack by the SEB Win Verificator, the way to prevents this is to install Safe Exam Browser normally, and then download Crack.zip.

# How to Compile Yourself

This is a Visual Studio 2022 project, this means you need to have Visual Studio 2022 Installed. To compile you will also need the WiX toolchain version 3.11 installed on your system aswell as an extension inside of visual studio code. During compiling you can get some errors, I have included the MicrosoftEdgeWebView2Setup.exe file that needs to be located at C:/Temp. If you get any errors regarding commands in a .targets file, you can use the .targets file I have uploaded.
